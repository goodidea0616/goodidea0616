ðŸ‘‹ Senior Full-Stack Developer ðŸ‘‹

I am an outstanding Full-Stack Developer who has been developing web and mobile sites and applications for almost 10 years, across virtually every industry. I freelance full-time and am always available during normal business hours across all time zones of US, West European or Australia as needed.

Whether you are starting a new project from the ground up or just need existing maintenance to an existing product, I can work on every aspect of your project (from front-end design to back-end integration), or just certain parts, based on your specific needs.

My main goals when working with you are simple:

- Clear and consistent communication. I make myself available during all waking hours to provide status updates, answer and ask questions, and discuss the project. Openness, trust, and friendliness have been the keys to success in my work.

- Complete satisfaction with the end result. I treat each project as unique and with its own set of needs. I will work with you along every step of the way to ensure that there are no surprises, and only satisfaction.
